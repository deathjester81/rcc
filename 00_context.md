# RCC Project Workspace – Mockup Context

Purpose:
This mockup visualizes RCC’s way of working per customer.
It is NOT a project management tool.
It is a read-only, explanatory interface.

Primary goal:
Show, per customer:
- what has been purchased and completed
- what is currently in progress
- what is available within the RCC portfolio

Secondary goal:
Allow customers to easily get in touch for additional modules
via a neutral "Kontakt aufnehmen" button.

Audience:
- RCC owner (overview & positioning)
- RCC customers (orientation & transparency)

Scope:
- Visual mockup only
- No real data handling
- No editing, no workflows
